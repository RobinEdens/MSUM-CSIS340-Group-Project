Personas

Jeremy - Employee (Customer Service/Returns), written by Robin

Jeremy is a customer service employee whose job is to process order-related issues such as returns or missing items. Jeremy is familiar with working a computer and using a search engine to look up results within the store's system. Jeremy is a newer hire, so he is not as familiar with other aspects of customer service as he is still in training. 

User Stories

User Story #1 (Jeremy, employee ), written by Robin 

As an employee, I want to be able to search a customer via email address & phone number so I can pull up order information for customers who do not have an order number on hand. 

Jeremy handles customer service and looks into issues occuring with an order. Sometimes, when a customer messages about a missing order or is requesting to cancel an order, they do not have the receipt or order information on hand. Jeremy would want some sort of method to look up an order via information that the customer would have entered during the checkout process.
